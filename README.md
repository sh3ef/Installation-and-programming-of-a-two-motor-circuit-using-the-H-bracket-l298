I used L293D IC instead of H Brage because it is not available in Tinckercad
# Connect L293D IC with Arduino UNO
The input and enable pins (ENA, INP1, INP2, INP3, INP4 and ENB) of the L293D IC are connected to the 6 digital output pins of the Arduino
  Connect one motor via OUT1 and OUT2 and the other motor via OUT3 and OUT4
